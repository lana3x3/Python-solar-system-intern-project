# Python-solar-system-intern-project
-Set Up the Environment and Data Exploration:
* ﻿﻿through Kaggle online, and necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, )
* ﻿﻿Download solar system datasets from Kaggle ( NASA Exoplanets
* A Comprehensive Catalogue of Exoplanets Discovered by NASA Missions)
* ﻿﻿Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
* ﻿﻿Identify and handle duplicates in the datasets. and removing them
* ﻿﻿Handle outliers and skewed distributions.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* ﻿﻿Visualize the distribution of key features like masses, and distances from the earth.
* ﻿﻿Explore relationships between features using scatter plots, pair plots.
-Data Visualization and Reporting:
* ﻿﻿Create detailed visualizations to communicate key insights, such as planetary comparisons, orbital paths, and celestial event timelines.
* ﻿﻿Use advanced visualization techniques like heatmaps, 3D plots .
* ﻿﻿Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the entire data analysis process, key findings, and visualizations.
